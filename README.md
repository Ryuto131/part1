To run this code, copy and paste the map and press "enter".
After that, press "Ctrl + z" to end the keying in and the results will be printed.
# task2
I could not solve it within the given 1.5h and the best i could do is to come up with a job-customer table with a score(The higher the score, the more compatible).
I have thought of trying have all combination of customer-job pair and adding the score, looking for a combination where the total score is the highest, thus making that combination the best assignment of jobs to custometr. Unfortunately, I could not figure that in time.
To run the code, copy and paste the input, press "enter", and then press "Ctrl + Z" and it will output the job customer table with the score. The column represents the customers and the row represents the job
